/// [`::stabby::IStable`]. This, technically, is a public dependency on
/// `::stabby`, whose major versions could then be technically perceived as
/// breaking for this crate too.
///
/// This crate takes the opinionated stance not to be deterred from publicly
/// exposing this wrapper nonetheless, trusting the users to know what they're
/// doing.
///
/// If you are unsure, **do not use this wrapper**.
///
/// [`::safer-ffi`][crate] waves any responsibility w.r.t. SemVer breakage that
/// may otherwise ensue.
